This application allows you to get the current and upcoming weather for any given city that you enter. This was made as a means to better understand how Web APIs function which is where this starts. A first fetch request is sent for information followed by a second fetch that pulls that weather data. A for loop iterates through the object returned and displays the information into the card divs. 

Thanks and have a good day!
